Falcon Platform was built around integrating with other services, from **BigCommerce** to **Stripe**.

Integrations often involve both handling data in our middleware (`falcon-server`) and using it on our frontend (`falcon-client`).

## Json Placeholder (EXAMPLE)
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ offers free and open APIs for testing.

We've created a guide showing how to integrate with this and use it's data on the frontout.

## Contentful (EXAMPLE)
https://www.contentful.com/ is an enterise, API first CMS.

We've created a guide showing how to integrate with this and use it's data on the frontout.
