Redirects can be added in 2 ways, **client side** & **server side**.

Both can be handled by [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/server-rendering).

- Server side routing uses `<StaticRouter />` (`import { StaticRouter } from "react-router-dom";`)
- Client side routing uses `<BrowserRouter />` (`import { BrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom";`)
