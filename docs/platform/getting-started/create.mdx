## Create Falcon App

To generate a new application based on Falcon Platform you can use our CLI tool, **create falcon app**.

:::note Using the new theme?
By default the demo based on "demo-v2" assumes it's connected to a **BigCommerce** instance, which uses **Algolia** and **Stripe**. Without these credentials the application will not start (you'll see the errors in the console). The old theme will, by default, be connected to our demo **Magento 2** and **Wordpress** instances.
:::

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs
  defaultValue="npm"
  values={[
    { label: 'NPM', value: 'npm', },
    { label: 'Yarn', value: 'yarn', }
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="npm">

```bash
npx @deity/create-falcon-app <project-name>
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn">

```bash
yarn create @deity/falcon-app <project-name>
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This will generate a Falcon site into a directory with the name of your projects (`<project-name>`).

```
project-name/
 |- server
 |- client
```

### Options

- `--example <name-of-example>` The example flag is used to define which example we want to start with. The options are `demo-v1`(default) and `demo-v2`.
  `demo-v1` by default connects to a demo **Magento 2** and **Wordpress** instance. To use the <a href="https://demo.deity.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest demo</a> use `demo-v2`. This requires you to have your own **BigCommerce**, **Algolia** and **Stripe** accounts.

```bash
npx @deity/create-falcon-app --example demo-v2 <project-name>

```

## Starting your app

To get your app started you'll need to start (and keep running), both **Falcon Client** and **Falcon Server**.

In 2 separate terminal windows go into each directory (`cd server/`, `cd client/`) and run the start command.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="npm"
  values={[
    { label: 'NPM', value: 'npm', },
    { label: 'Yarn', value: 'yarn', }
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="npm">

**Server**
```bash
cd server/
npm start
```

**Client**
```bash
cd client/
npm start
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn">

**Server**
```bash
cd server/
yarn start
```

**Client**
```bash
cd client/
yarn start
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once these have started, visit <a href="http://localhost:3000" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">http://localhost:3000</a> to see your app.

---

:::note Adding your project to git.
We recommend that you keep both **client** and **server** in one **git repository** even if you're hosting them in different places. If you're using our **cloud** service this is a requirement.
