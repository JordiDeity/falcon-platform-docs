In this tutorial we will implement a **basic** integration with <a href="https://www.contentful.com//" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Contentful</a>.

Contentful provide a few ways to get data, including **GraphQL**. In this tutorial we will be using **REST** as it's included in all their plans.

:::note Read this first
We recommend you go through [this](json-placeholder) example first as we will be skipping past a few details.
:::

## Overview

We will get 'course' data from <a href="https://www.contentful.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Contentfuls</a> example data. 

We will expalin adding API auth details to server + `server/config/local.json` file.

## 1. Getting set up with Contentful

### Create an account

If you don't already have a Contentful you'll have to create one. This is easy and they have free plans if you're just testing it out.

### Set up your content model

This tutorial focusses on getting a **course** content model. This comes as part of their example data.  If you're not using this model a few details later on may vary.

### Add some content entries

Once you've got your content model setup you'll need to add some content. Again we are using the sample data that comes with 2 'courses' ('Hello Contentful' & 'Hello SDKs').

### Get your credentials

The last thing you'll need to do on Contentfuls side is get your credentials.

You'll need your:

- Content Delivery API key
- Space ID
- Environment ID
- Content Type ID

You can get all of these from your admin.

![contentful admin](/img/docs/platform/contentful-admin.png)

You can get your `Content Delivery API Key` and `Space ID` from the API keys section in your dashboard.

Your `Environment ID` from the environments section. If you're using sample data, this is **master**.

To get your `Content Type ID` go to your content model and it will be in the sidebar. Using the sample data it will be **course**.

## 2. Creating your API and Extension packages

:::note Want to test your API outside of Falcon Platform?
Contentful have a really handy <a href="https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-delivery-api/#/reference/content-types/content-type/get-a-single-content-type/console" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">API testing tool</a> as part of their docs meaning you don't need to use a tool like <a href="https://www.postman.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopenner">Postman</a>.
:::

**`server/config/default.json`**
```json
```

## 3. Adding your credentials locally

We don't want to commit our API keys so, for now we'll add these to a `server/config/local.json`. This is merged into your `default.json` but not commited ([see this doc for more information](/docs/platform/client/configuration)).

The name of the API needs to be the same as in `server/config/default.json`. In this case it's `contentful`.

**`server/config/local.json`**
```json
{
  ...
  "apis": {
    "contentful": {
      "config": {
        "spaceId": "[SPACE_ID]",
        "contentDeliveryApi": "[CONTENT_DELIVERY_API]",
        "environment": "[ENVIRONMENT_ID]"
      }
    }
  },
}

```

## 4. Testing your GraphQL

## 5. Using your data in Falcon Client

## 6. Moving your credentials to your environment

## 7. Finished
