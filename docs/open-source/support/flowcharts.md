title: Working with flowcharts
---

We recommend using [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/) service while working with flowcharts.

Keep in mind, whenever you export your flowchart PNG file - make sure you have the following settings in
your "export" window:

![Draw.io export](assets/draw-io-export.png)

> This will provide a high resolution quality for the rendered images.

## Flowchart files

Every flowchart file in Falcon Docs must be located in `docs/assets` folder next to the rendered PNG file with the same
filename (+ `.xml` extension).
For example, `docs/assets/payment-workflow.png` is a rendered image of `docs/assets/payment-workflow.xml` flowchart file.

Make sure you always follow this convention and keep both files updated and tracked by GIT.
